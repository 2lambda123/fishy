Why fishy
---------

In our research regarding existing tools for filesystem based data hinding
techniques we only came up with a hand full of tool. Nnone of these provide a
consistent interface for multiple filesystems and various hiding techniques.
For most of them it seemed, that development has been stopped.

With this background, there is no currently active framework for filesystem
based data hinding techniques, other than fishy. As fishy aimes to provide an
easy to use framework for creating new hiding techniques, this project might be
useful for all security researchers, which are concerned with data hiding.


Limitations
-----------

* Currently only Linux is supported and tested
* Currently no support for storing multiple files
