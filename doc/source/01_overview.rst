Documentation Overview
======================

This paragraph will provide a brief overview of this paper, giving a short summary of its structure. 
You will be introduced to the paper by its abstract. 
To give beginners a fast start with the tool, the abstract is followed by the  `getting started`- section,
which is followed by an introduction to fishy. After this overview you will find an explanation of the 
filesystems datastructure and hiding techniques supported by this tool. Fishys module structure will be 
shown after that, the code documentation follows. The hiding techniques are evaluated shortly before a 
future work section. The appendix contains a tutorial to create testing filesystem and a listing of
responsibilities.
