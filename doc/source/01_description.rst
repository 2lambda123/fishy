fishy is a toolkit for filesystem based data hiding techniques implemented in Python. It collects various common exploitation methods that make use of existing data structures on the filesystem layer, for hiding data from conventional file access methods. Furthermore, it brings a variety of hiding techniques which may be detected by some file checkers or forensic tools. Inside the documentation is all the necessary information with the explicit details. It supports the filesystems FAT, NTFS and ext4. The main goal of the toolkit is only to hide data and needs encrypted data as input if the user wants a further obfuscation. This toolkit is intended to introduce people to the concept of established anti-forensic methods associated with data hiding.
